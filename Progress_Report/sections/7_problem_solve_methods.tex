\section{Problem Solving Methods}
Given that the group is fairly big in size, there are many resources that the team has. If the team happens to become fixed on a problem, collective problem solving is a good first step as there are a wide array of skills in the group. If the problem is not something the group can overcome, the team has a wide variety of resources from previous coursework to online resources and forums available for programming and hardware along with a host of documentation available for Arduino, Python, MySQL, etc... There are also websites such as github where open-source code can be viewed and analyzed in an attempt to solve a problem in the teamâ€™s own system. For the biomedical side, there are various resources from courses that Kate has taken that can be an asset such as Bioelectrical Systems (SYSC 3203), Bioinstrumentation and Signals (SYSC4203), and Biomedical Systems, Modeling, and Control (SYSC 3610). As well, there are many biomedical studies that can be found through research of accredited online journals.
