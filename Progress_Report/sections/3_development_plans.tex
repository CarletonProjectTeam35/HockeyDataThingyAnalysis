\section{Development Plans}
The current plan for the progression of the project is to complete the upgraded web application, as well as the centralization of all hardware into one location. With that completed, the web application will be pushed onto a website to allow for easy remote access. With that completed, data collection will begin. As will be discussed in the Next Steps the plans for data collection have been changed as a contingency due to the pandemic with testing being pushed back. However, the changes to the software are being developed to allow for a more easy process of going from receiving the data to analyzing the data making the turn over for the Final Project Report and writings in preparation for the Oral presentations easier and simpler.
%need to probably expand upon this but I don't currently have any ideas.
